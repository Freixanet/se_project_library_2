### **About The Project**

This project is a practical implementation of a static website based on a detailed design brief. The main goal was to create a pixel-perfect representation of the design using only HTML and CSS, while adhering to best practices for code structure and performance.

The page is fully static and does not use any JavaScript for its core functionality. It features several sections, including a header, upcoming events, staff book picks, membership information, and a footer.

### **Key Features**

- **Semantic HTML5:** The structure uses semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) for improved accessibility and SEO.
- **BEM Methodology:** CSS classes are named following the Block, Element, Modifier convention, resulting in a modular, scalable, and easy-to-read stylesheet.
- **Flexbox Layout:** The layout is built primarily with Flexbox, demonstrating a modern approach to creating complex and responsive element arrangements.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - **Lazy Loading:** Images outside the initial viewport use the `loading="lazy"` attribute to defer loading and improve initial page speed.
  - **Async Decoding:** The `decoding="async"` attribute is used on images to prevent them from blocking the main thread during rendering.
- **Clean Code:** The codebase is formatted with Prettier and follows the guidelines provided in the `.editorconfig` file to ensure consistency.
